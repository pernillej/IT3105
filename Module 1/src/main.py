    Keyword arguments:
    case - Config for case to run

    Results:
    1. A plot of the progression of the training-set error from start to end of training. Each data point is the average
    (per case) error for a single mini-batch.
    2. A plot of the progression of the validation-set error from start to end of training.
    3. A listing of the error percentage for the training and test sets, as evaluated after training has finished.

    Additional visualization:
    1. Mapping - This involves taking a small sample of data cases (e.g. 10-20 examples) and running them through the
    network, with learning turned off. The activation levels of a user-chosen set of layers are then displayed for
    each case.
    2. Dendrograms - For any given network layer, a comparison of the different activation vectors (across all cases of
    a mapping) can then serve as the basis for a dendrogram, a convenient graphic indicator of the networkâ€™s general
    ability to partition data into relevant groups.
    3. Weight and Bias Viewing - These are simple graphic views of the weights and/or biases associated with the
    connections between any user-chosen pairs of layers. Although you may want to display weights and biases
    intermittently during a run, this assignment only requires their visualization at the end of a run.
