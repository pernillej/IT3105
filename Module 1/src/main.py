    Keyword arguments:
    case - Config for case to run

    Results:
    1. A plot of the progression of the training-set error from start to end of training. Each data point is the average
    (per case) error for a single mini-batch.
    2. A plot of the progression of the validation-set error from start to end of training.
    3. A listing of the error percentage for the training and test sets, as evaluated after training has finished.

    Additional visualization:
    1. Mapping - This involves taking a small sample of data cases (e.g. 10-20 examples) and running them through the
    network, with learning turned off. The activation levels of a user-chosen set of layers are then displayed for
    each case.
    2. Dendrograms - For any given network layer, a comparison of the different activation vectors (across all cases of
    a mapping) can then serve as the basis for a dendrogram, a convenient graphic indicator of the networkâ€™s general
    ability to partition data into relevant groups.
    3. Weight and Bias Viewing - These are simple graphic views of the weights and/or biases associated with the
    connections between any user-chosen pairs of layers. Although you may want to display weights and biases
    intermittently during a run, this assignment only requires their visualization at the end of a run.

    # TODO - A plot showing the progression of training-set and validation-set error (as a function of the training
    # steps, where each step involves the processing of one minibatch).

    # TODO - A display of the weights and biases for any user-chosen areas of the network, for example, the weights
    # between layers 1 and 2 and the biases for layer 2. Typically, these are only shown at the end of the run, but
    # displaying them intermittently is also useful.

    # TODO - The sets of corresponding activation levels for user-chosen layers that result from a post-training mapping
    #  run (as described in details file).

    # TODO - Dendrograms (also described details file), which graphically display relationships between input patterns
    # and the hidden-layer activations that they invoke.
